    <p>about me:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>i am the co-founder and cto at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.loom.com">loom</a>.
      <ul>
        <li>loom is a $350m company which my co-founders and i have raised over $75m of funding for.</li>
        <li>we employ 120 extremely talented people from new zealand to poland.</li>
        <li>loom is used by over 10m people worldwide.</li>
        <li>we are increasing access to economic opportunity in an increasingly remote and distributed world where english is not everyone's first language and cross-timezone collaboration is an increasingly bigger problem. simply put, we are building tools which help people communicate more effectively and get ahead.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>i invest in companies and am willing to offer help to founders i vibe with for free and for no allocation.</li>
    <li>i care about animal welfare and the environment, and i believe lab-grown meat is the solution to most of these problems.</li>
    <li>i care about the future of san francisco and its issues with mental health, homelessness and drug use.</li>
    <li>i don't care for online ego games, but i understand the games need to be played for some people and don't judge. i am lucky enough to have amassed enough wealth to not need to partake.</li>
    <li>i don't like taking myself too seriously, and i like being around accomplished people with grit who haven't lost their ability to keep it real.</li>
    <li>i am a bit of a hippy. i regularly take psychedelics, do cold water/sauna therapy, and i meditate as much as i can.</li>
    <li>i am a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Conscious-Capitalism-New-Preface-Authors/dp/1625271751">conscious capitalist</a>.</li>
    <li>i need adventure to be happy. i ride motorcycles, rock climb, lift weights, and am usually down to try anything once.</li>
